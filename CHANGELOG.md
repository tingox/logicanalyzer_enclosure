2024-10-28: test print
-------------------------
general comments
- usb cutout needs to be 2 - 3 mm closer to top of lid
- text on top is readable, but color contrast would be better
- text on left side and on bottom is too smal to be readable
- perhaps a deeper cut would show up better?

standoffs
-------
- standoffs should be 2 mm closer to both edges
- top standoffs should be ~1 mm shorter
